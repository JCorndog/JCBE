Project Description
Our project, “Neural Network AI Tag”, is based around a game of tag as a 2D platformer with chaser and evader AI. We are implementing the game itself and the controllers for the AI using Unity and C# and are tentatively considering using TensorFlow for the neural net. This project aims to challenge ourselves to dive into the concept of neural nets and figure out how we can get them to collaborate. Games such as Dota 2 have implemented collaborative AI’s to accomplish tasks, our hope is to do this on a smaller scale. The project is being developed by Jack Cordonnier and Ben Elfner and will be completed in the Spring of 2022.
