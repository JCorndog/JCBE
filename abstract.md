#Abstract
Our project is focused on developing a game of tag as a 2D platformer with specialized chaser and evader AI. 
The chaser AI(s) will work together to catch the evader. 
The game simulation will be written in a language conducive to quickly teach the AI through iterative learning. 
We will utilize neural networks to train and improve our AI’s performance. 
This project idea is something that pushes the envelope when it comes to video game AI, since AI’s tend to work alone and we are attempting to evolve that into a more collaborative AI approach.
