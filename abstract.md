# Abstract
Our project was focused on developing a game of tag as a 2D platformer with specialized chaser and evader AI. 
The chaser AI attempts to catch the evader using the information provided to it by the neural network.
The game simulation will be written in a language conducive to quickly teach the AI through iterative learning. 
We have utilized neural networks to train and improve our AI’s performance. 
This project idea is something that pushes the envelope when it comes to video game AI, since AI’s tend to work alone and we are attempting to evolve that into a more collaborative AI approach.
This project is a good framework for future neural network development since it allows the solving of a varying number of solutions using our application structure.
