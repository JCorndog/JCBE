**Project Focus**	

A game of tag as a 2D platformer with specialized chaser and evader AI. The chaser AI(s) will work together to catch the evader. The game simulation will be written in a language conducive to quickly teach the AI through iterative learning. This project idea is something that pushes the envelope when it comes to video game AI, since AI’s tend to work alone and we are attempting to evolve that into a more collaborative AI approach.

[Github repo](https://github.com/JCorndog/JCBE) - https://github.com/JCorndog/JCBEMore detail about the project and our aims can be found on Writing Assignment 3 where we go into detail on our personal backgrounds and skill sets that led us to pick this project idea.
