For Jack, a large portion of his work was focused on developing the application in Unity that the neural network would train on. Most of his time spent in the fall dealt with preparing our team for the actual development/coding which is why so much time was spent with research and documentation. For the spring semester, Unity was the main body of work and it required him to learn Unity from the ground up. After learning of how to generally leverage what Unity had to offer, the other part of the work was connecting his work with the Neural Network that Ben was developing.

Simmilarly in the fall, Ben spent a lot of time doing research about training methodologies and strategies and what software we would use to train the neural network. Prototyping also occured in the fall which helps us hone in on what we wanted our solution to look like. In the spring, Ben had the difficult task of recieving the input from the Unity game and having the neural network digest it. The neural network was complex in it's design and construction. Another large time sink for Ben was developing the method of communication for Unity and the Python training server to use. 

Lastly, we both had to spend a large chunk of time training the neural network on our GPU's, which required monitoring on our part.
